# NeverLetGo: Introduction to Kaggle & Machine Learning 
"Never let go" is a famous line from the popular film starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio depicting the love of Rose and Jack, respectively. Unfortunately, only one of them survives the tragic fate to befall the mighty steamship as it careens into an iceberg. 
 
In real life, the tale of the Titanic has captured the imagination of folks the world over. As such, there are many tie-ins to the infamous disaster from films to documentaries to merchandise, exploration, and even data science. Which is where we come in. This repository showcases our group work as we tackled the introductory learning Kaggle competition [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). 

# Process
We began our work using Jupyter Notebook and then converted our visualizations into a Tableau dashboard (below).
